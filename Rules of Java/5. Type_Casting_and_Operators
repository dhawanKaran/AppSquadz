Type Casting is a process of converting the value of one data type into another data type.

Whenever we are converting the value of smaller data type into a bigger data type then it is known as implicit type casting and this process is called Widening.

Whenever we are converting the value of bigger data type into a smaller data type then it is known as explicit type casting and this process is called Narrowing.




Operating are just a symbols which are used to perform different type of calculation on own data.
