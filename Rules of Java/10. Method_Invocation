The Java programming language provides two basic kind of methods; instance methods and class (or static) methods are:

Instance methods require an instance before they can be invoked; class (static) methods do not,

1. Instance methods use dynamic (late) binding; class methods use static (early) binding.

2. The java virtual machine uses two different instruction to invoke these two different kind of methods: invoke virtual for instance methods and invoke static for class methods.
