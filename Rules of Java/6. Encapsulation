Encapsulation: Wrapping up data members and member functions into a single unit.

Class: Class is representation of similar types of objects and it is an implementation of encaapsulation.

If data members of class are not static then by default they are instance.

The portion of a class which is getting a memory at class loading time that can get the memory only once in the life cycle of a class and this process is known as static memory allocation.

The portion of a class which is getting a memory at runtime that can get the memory again and again in the life cycle of a class and this process is known as dynamic memory allocation.

All the functions of a class are always getting a memory at a class loading time.

"New" operator is used to allocate a memory at runtime in java.
