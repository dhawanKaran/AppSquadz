1. Always keep those properties of an object as a static data members of class whose values are same for each object.

2. All the static data members of a class are always getting a memory at class loading time.

3. All the static data members of a class always get the memory only once in the life cycle of a class.

4. All the objects are sharing same memory location for each static data members of class.

5. All the instance thing (DM + MF) of a class always belong to an object they are treated as properties of an object.
  
6. All the static thing (DM + MF) of a class always belong to a class they are treated as properties of a class.

7. Never use static thing (DM + MF) of a class via object.

8. Static data members of class can be initialized at class level.

9. Why main() function is kept as static and the answer is because it is not doing any task related to any object.

10. Why main() function is kept as public and the answer is because it is called from outside the class.

11. Why main() function is having a return type as a void and the answer is because it is not returning any value to the JVM.

12. Always keep those behaviours of an object as a static functions of a class which are not doing any task related to any object or in which you are not using instance data members of class.

13. Instance data members and instance member functions of a class can not be used in any static functions of the same class but they can be used after creating the object of class in static functions.

14. Static data members and static member functions of a class can be used directly in any function of the same class.

15. The reference id of one object can be put into any number of reference variables.
