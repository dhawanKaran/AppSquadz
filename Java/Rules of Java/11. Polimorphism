1. One name many form.

2. Ability to take more than one form.

3. Whenever an object gives a different different behaviours in different different conditions or circumstances then that behaviour of object is known as polimorphism.

4. It reduces the complexity of an object.

5. Polimorphism is always achieved via behaviour of an object properties of an object do not play any role in case of polimorphism.

6. Java does not support operator overloading explicity.

7. Java does not support compile time polimorphism.

8. Virtual functions are always bound at runtime.

9. In java all the instance functions of a class are implicit virtual.
